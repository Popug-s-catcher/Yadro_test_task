# Yadro_test_task
Income counter for the day of the computer club.

Code is at /task/src. Input files are at /task/tests. 

There are two types of test files: 
- test(N).txt - regular test;
- testW(N).txt - test of checking incorrect input.

  where (N) - is test number.

After clonning the repository go to /task/src and write "g++ main.cpp && ./a.out test(N).txt" in terminal to build and run.

All the output would be in terminal.
